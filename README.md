# Continuous Density Estimation Benchmark Datasets

A collection of continuous datasets used in machine learning for density
estimation.

For a binary version, see [UCLA's StarAI DEBD](https://github.com/UCLA-StarAI/Density-Estimation-Datasets),
which is forked from [Vergari's DEBD](https://github.com/arranger1044/DEBD).
